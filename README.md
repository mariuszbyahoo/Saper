# Saper

+ Project is currently under construction
Therefore I need to admit, that it is not a priority for me now, for example if there will be an exit() method with a Thread.sleep(x) then even a MediaPlayer stops working, and even a Tile doesn't changing the fill colour when clicked, therefore, I would like to learn Spring, Maven and the Dependency Injection faster than to finish a little JavaFX app, to make it finished.
