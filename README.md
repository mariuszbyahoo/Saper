# Saper

  Project is currently under construction
Therefore I need to admit, that it is not a priority for me now, I will sometimes add a line or two.

Currently working:
+ Randomly planted mines (Done)
+ Explosion sound (Done)
+ Exiting the application after a mine explodes (Done)
+ Moving the System.exit() to a different thread (Done)
